# EPINET

The Project “EPINET: Monthly Progress Report” is designed for the generation of reports containing the data about work done at various sites and basins of ONGC.
This project includes some user functionalities related to various data modification, creation, and drafting of the reports. Realizing the need of today we focused on developing a portal which has the facility of providing the required information to all the users and also which is globally viewable.
Observing the drawbacks in the existing system, we automated various functionalities in the portal. The proposed system is developed taking into consideration to overwhelm the extensive drawbacks of the existing system. For this purpose, we first focused on developing a good user interface which is quite user-friendly along with effective interaction with the database. We also got to generate the PDF for all the data entered by the user.
